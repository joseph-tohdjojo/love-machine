A node app to get my machine configured just the way I like it

### How do I get set up?
* You will need Node installed. I recommend [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script).
* You will need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm start`
* Answer the prompt questions
